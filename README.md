# NovaCraft

side project I work on on and off, basically a minecraft clone
clone and run `cargo run --release` if interested
there are other blocks in the inverntory, press `Q` to scroll through the inventory. Or [`1`, `2`, `R`, `Z`, `X`, `V`, `G`, `C`, `F`] for the corresponding place in the inventory
`L` to swap gamemodes
